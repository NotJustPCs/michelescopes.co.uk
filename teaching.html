				<h3>About me</h3>
			</div>
				<div class="p-box first half">
				
				<p>I am a young, enthusiastic fun teacher, happy to teach any age and any standard.</p>
				<p>I started to play the violin at the age of five and after many years of hard work and inspirational teachers I knew the violin would be my future!
				In 2003 I graduated from Kingston University with a Bachelor of Music Honours 2:1.
				In 2004 I completed a postgraduate in Performance at Birmingham Conservatoire.</p>
				<p>In both my degrees I covered many aspects of performance and teaching. I gained valuable experience in various teaching environments including classroom music, small groups&#39 and one to one tuition.</p>
				<p>Along with teaching I regularly perform which ensures I keep &#39in tune&#39 with music activities and opportunities for my pupils to get involved within the local area.</p>

				<h3>Lessons</h3>
			</div>	
			<div class="p-box 2-column">
					<p>Pupils can be any age and standard to learn with me. Currently my youngest pupil is three years, and my eldest is in their 80&#39s! So you&#39re never too young or too old to start something new!</p>
					<p>I teach from my fully equipped, sound-proofed music room in Portslade, East Sussex. All lessons are one to one tuition and depending on the standard and age of my pupils the lesson time can range from half an hour to an hour.</p>
					<p>My pupils all have individual goals when learning the violin and to accommodate this I am extremely flexible in my teaching style. I am happy to take any approach to lessons; whether it is purely for fun, achieving a music grade, entry to a competition, G.C.S.E performance or entry exams for music college. Anything is possible!</p>
					<p>One aspect I consistently encourage my students to do is PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!!! All my pupils are expected to practice regularly, which enables them to see progress in their learning and enjoy the music they play. </p>
					<p>Most importantly I have a work ethic to always make my music lessons fun. </p>

					<h3>Music Theory</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="p-box half">
					<p>Music Theory is a vital part of studying which fits along side instrumental lessons. As you progress in the violin or any other instrument your playing skills will need to be supported with the knowledge of Music Theory. Within my violin lessons I will integrate Music Theory to aid the performance of pieces and background knowledge of the structure of the music.</p>
					<p>When your standard of playing reaches Grade 5, to enable you to take further Grades you will need to take your Grade 5 Theory exam.  At this level I offer special tuition to concentrate on passing the exam. In the lessons we will work though workbooks and specific exercises in weak areas and also practice past papers to prepare for the exam.</p>

						<h3>Testimonials</h3>
					</div>
				
						<blockquote>"Michele has been my violin teacher for 7 years and has really shaped me and helped me grow as a musician since starting with her at a grade 4 level.<br>She is always as kind and as welcoming as she was my first lesson with her, and very organised in her schedule making it easy and convenient to book lessons. She understands that each musician is different, providing lessons that are suited to the individual, and advice on what is best for you and your playing according to your own strengths and weaknesses. Michele has always been honest and clear in her way of explaining things, which has made learning violin with her a great joy for me.<br>I would highly recommend her to anyone interested in starting to learn the violin, or those who feel they would like to change to a more professional and able music teacher like I did." - <span style="color: black">Amelia (pupil)</span></blockquote>
						<blockquote>"Thank you for being such a great teacher and helping me pass my Grade 5 violin and get a merit for my theory exam! I could not have done it without you." - <span style="color: black">Matilda (pupil) </span></blockquote>
						<blockquote>"Michele is an excellent teacher. Lessons are fun most of all, but her understanding of technique and how to teach means my two children have made great progress with the violin and becoming musicians." - <span style="color: black">Keith (parent)</span></blockquote>
						<blockquote class="last">"I was just writing to say a massive thank you for everything you've taught me. You have been an amazing teacher and you have been patient, kind and inspiring for me. I can't thank you enough for having taught me the violin" - <span style="color: black">Anya (pupil) </span></blockquote>
